Hello and welcome!

You're in my humble home on the Internet. Here, I will mostly blog about topics on Software Development, including, but not limited to Swift and Apple platforms: iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS.

If you want to get in touch, know more about me, report mistakes, suggest improvements, or just discuss, you can contact me through social media and my email, just look at the footer of this website.

That's it for now, enjoy your visit!
